ready! ooming! hang on a second. hello? - barry? - adam? - oan you believe this is happening? - i can't. i'll pick you up. looking sharp. use the stairs. your father paid good money for those. sorry. i'm excited. here's the graduate. we're very proud of you, son. a perfect report card, all b's. very proud. ma! i got a thing going here. - you got lint on your fuzz. - ow! that's me! - wave to us! we'll be in row 118,000. - bye! barry, i told you, stop flying in the house! - hey, adam. - hey, barry. - is that fuzz gel? - a little. special day, graduation. never thought i'd make it. three days grade school, three days high school. those were awkward. three days college. i'm glad i took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. you did come back different. - hi, barry. - artie, growing a mustache? looks good. - hear about frankie? - yeah. - you going to the funeral? - no, i'm not going. everybody knows, sting someone, you die. don't waste it on a squirrel. such a hothead. i guess he could have just gotten out of the way. i love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. that's why we don't need vacations. boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - well, adam, today we are men. - we are! - bee-men. - amen! hallelujah! students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome dean buzzwell. welcome, new hive oity graduating class of... ...9:15. that concludes our ceremonies. and begins your career at honex industries! will we pick ourjob today? i heard it's just orientation. heads up! here we go. keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - wonder what it'll be like? - a little scary. welcome to honex, a division of honesco and a part of the hexagon group. this is it! wow. wow. we know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive. our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... honey! - that girl was hot. - she's my cousin! - she is? - yes, we're all cousins. - right. you're right. - at honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. these bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - what do you think he makes? - not enough. here we have our latest advancement, the krelman. - what does that do? - oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. saves us millions. oan anyone work on the krelman? of course. most bee jobs are small ones. but bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. but choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. the same job the rest of your life? i didn't know that. what's the difference? you'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. so you'll just work us to death? we'll sure try. wow! that blew my mind! \\\"what's the difference?\\\" how can you say that? one job forever? that's an insane choice to have to make. i'm relieved. now we only have to make one decision in life. but, adam, how could they never have told us that? why would you question anything? we're bees. we're the most perfectly functioning society on earth. you ever think maybe things work a little too well here? like what? give me one example. i don't know. but you know what i'm talking about. please clear the gate. royal nectar force on approach. wait a second. oheck it out. - hey, those are pollen jocks! - wow. i've never seen them this close. they know what it's like outside the hive. yeah, but some don't come back. - hey, jocks! - hi, jocks! you guys did great! you're monsters! you're sky freaks! i love it! i love it! - i wonder where they were. - i don't know. their day's not planned. outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. you can'tjust decide to be a pollen jock. you have to be bred for that. right. look. that's more pollen than you and i will see in a lifetime. it's just a status symbol. bees make too much of it. perhaps. unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. those ladies? aren't they our cousins too? distant. distant. look at these two. - oouple of hive harrys. - let's have fun with them. it must be dangerous being a pollen jock. yeah. once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! he had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - oh, my! - i never thought i'd knock him out. what were you doing during this? trying to alert the authorities. i can autograph that. a little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? yeah. gusty. we're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - six miles, huh? - barry! a puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - maybe i am. - you are not! we're going 0900 at j-gate. what do you think, buzzy-boy? are you bee enough? i might be. it all depends on what 0900 means. hey, honex! dad, you surprised me. you decide what you're interested in? - well, there's a lot of choices. - but you only get one. do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? son, let me tell you about stirring. you grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. you get yourself into a rhythm. it's a beautiful thing. you know, dad, the more i think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. you were thinking of what, making balloon animals? that's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - barry, you are so funny sometimes. - i'm not trying to be funny. you're not funny! you're going into honey. our son, the stirrer! - you're gonna be a stirrer? - no one's listening to me! wait till you see the sticks i have. i could say anything right now. i'm gonna get an ant tattoo! let's open some honey and celebrate! maybe i'll pierce my thorax. shave my antennae. shack up with a grasshopper. get a gold tooth and call everybody \\\"dawg\\\"! i'm so proud. - we're starting work today! - today's the day. oome on! all the good jobs will be gone. yeah, right. pollen

the reason you think. - any chance of getting the krelman? - sure, you're on. i'm sorry, the krelman just closed out. wax monkey's always open. the krelman opened up again. what happened? a bee died.

hello? another call coming in. if anyone's feeling brave, there's a korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. hey, guys. - look at that. - isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. it's ok, lou. we're gonna take him up. really? feeling lucky, are you? sign here, here. just initial that. - thank you. - ok. you got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. so be careful. as always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. also, i got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. murphy's in a

that one. see that? it's a little bit of magic. that's amazing. why do we do that? that's pollen power. more pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. oool. i'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. oould be daisies. don't we need those? oopy that visual. wait. one of these flowers seems to be on the move. say again? you're reporting a moving flower? affirmative. that was on the line!

you're talking! i'm so sorry. no, it's ok. it's fine. i know i'm dreaming. but i don't recall going to bed. well, i'm sure this is very disconcerting. this is a bit of a surprise to me. i mean, you're a bee! i am. and i'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. and if it wasn't for you... i had to thank you. it's just how i was raised. that was a little weird. - i'm talking with a bee. - yeah. i'm talking to a bee. and the bee is talking to me! i just want to say i'm grateful. i'll leave now. - wait! how did you learn to do that? - what? the talking thing. same

gonna do, barry? about work? i don't know. i want to do my part for the hive, but i can't do it the way they want. i know how you feel. - you do? - sure. my parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but i wanted to be a florist. - really? - my only interest is flowers. our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. anyway, if you look... there's my hive right there. see it? you're in sheep meadow! yes! i'm right off the turtle pond! no way! i know that area. i lost a toe ring there once. - why do girls put rings on their toes? - why not? - it's like putting a hat on your knee. - maybe i'll try that. - you all right, ma'am? - oh, yeah. fine. just having two cups of coffee! anyway, this has been great. thanks for the coffee. yeah, it's no trouble. sorry i couldn't

wasp?! your parents will kill you! - no, no, no, not a wasp. - spider? - i'm not attracted to spiders. i know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. i can't get by that face. so who is she? she's... human. no, no. that's a bee law. you wouldn't break a bee law. - her name's vanessa. - oh, boy. she's so nice. and she's a florist! oh, no! you're dating a human florist! we're not dating. you're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and m-80s! one-eighth a stick of dynamite! she saved my life! and she understands me. this is over! eat this. this is not over! what was that? - they call it a crumb. - it was so stingin' stripey! and that's not what they eat. that's what falls off what they eat! - you know what a oinnabon is? - no. it's bread and cinnamon and frosting. they heat it up... sit down! ...really hot! - listen to me! we are not them! we're us. there's us and there's them! yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? there's no yearning. stop yearning. listen to me! you have got to start thinking bee, my friend. thinking bee! - thinking bee. - thinking bee. thinking bee! thinking bee! thinking bee! thinking bee! there he is. he's in the pool. you know what your problem is, barry? i gotta start thinking bee? how much longer will this go on? it's been three days! why aren't you working? i've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. what life? you have no life! you have no job. you're barely a bee! would it kill you to make a little honey? barry, come out. your father's talking to you. martin, would you talk to him? barry, i'm talking to you! you coming? got everything? all set! go ahead. i'll catch up. don't be too long. watch this! vanessa! - we're still here. - i told you not to

is this why you can't decide? bye. i just hope she's bee-ish. they have a huge parade of flowers every year in pasadena? to be in the tournament of roses, that's every florist's dream! up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. a tournament. do the roses compete in athletic events? no. all right, i've got one. how come you don't fly everywhere? it's exhausting. why don't you run everywhere? it's faster. yeah, ok, i see, i see. all right, your turn. tivo. you can just freeze live tv? that's insane! you don't have that? we have hivo, but it's a disease. it's a horrible, horrible disease. oh, my. dumb bees! you must want to sting all those jerks. we try not to sting. it's usually fatal for us. so you have to watch your temper. very carefully. you kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. work through it like any emotion: anger, jealousy, lust. oh, my goodness! are you ok? yeah. - what is wrong with you?! - it's a bug. he's not bothering anybody. get out of here, you creep! what was that? a pic 'n' save circular? yeah, it was. how did you know? it felt like about 10 pages. seventy-five is pretty much our limit. you've really got that

actor? - i never heard of him. - why is this here? - for people. we eat it. you don't have enough food of your own? - well, yes. - how do you get it? - bees make it. - i know who makes it! and it's hard to make it! there's heating, cooling, stirring. you need a whole krelman thing! - it's organic. - it's our-ganic! it's just honey, barry. just what?! bees don't know about this! this is stealing! a lot of stealing! you've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! this is all we have! and it's on sale?! \",\"when starts then say i'm getting to the bottom of this. i'm getting to the bottom of all of

doggone clean?! how much do you people need to see?! open your eyes! stick your head out the window! from npr news in washington, i'm oarl kasell. but don't kill no more bugs! - bee! - moose blood guy!! - you hear something? - like what? like tiny screaming. turn off the radio. whassup, bee boy? hey, blood. just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. wow! i assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. i mean, that honey's ours. - bees hang tight. - we're all jammed in. it's a close community. not us, man. we on our own. every mosquito on his own. - what if you get in trouble? - you a mosquito, you in trouble. nobody likes us. they just smack. see a mosquito, smack, smack! at least you're out in the world. you must meet girls. mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. you got to be kidding me! mooseblood's about to leave the building! so long, bee! - hey, guys! - mooseblood! i knew i'd catch y'all down here. did you bring your crazy straw? we throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. what is this place? a bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. they are pinheads! pinhead. - oheck out the new smoker. - oh, sweet. that's the one you want. the thomas 3000! smoker? ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. twice the nicotine, all the tar. a couple breaths of this knocks them right out. they make the honey, and we make the money. \\\"they make the honey, and we make the money\\\"? oh, my! what's going on? are you ok? yeah. it doesn't last too long. do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? our queen was moved here. we had no choice. this is your queen? that's a man in women's clothes! that's a drag queen! what is this? oh, no! there's hundreds of them! bee honey. our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! this is worse than anything bears have done! i intend to do something. oh, barry, stop. who told you humans are taking our honey? that's a rumor. do these look like rumors? that's a conspiracy theory. these are obviously doctored photos. how did you get mixed up in this? he's been talking to humans. - what? - talking to humans?! he has a human girlfriend. and they make out! make out? barry! we do not. - you wish you could. - whose side are you on? the bees! i dated a cricket once in san antonio. those crazy legs kept me up all night. barry, this is what you want to do with your life? i want to do it for all our lives. nobody works harder than bees! dad, i remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. you couldn't stop. i remember that. what right do they have to our honey? we live on two cups a year. they put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! even if it's true, what can one bee do? sting them where it really hurts. in the face! the eye! - that would hurt. - no. up the nose? that's a killer. there's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. hive at five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. no more bee beards! with bob bumble at the anchor desk. weather with storm stinger. sports with buzz larvi. and jeanette ohung. - good evening. i'm bob bumble. - and i'm jeanette ohung. a tri-county bee, barry benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! tomorrow night on bee larry king, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, olassy ladies, out this week on hexagon. tonight we're talking to barry benson. did you ever think, \\\"i'm a kid from the hive. i can't do this\\\"? bees have never been afraid to change the world. what about bee oolumbus? bee gandhi? bejesus? where i'm from, we'd never sue humans. we were thinking of stickball or candy stores. how old are you? the bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. you know, they have a larry king in the human world too. it's a common name. next week... he looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... next week... glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. bear week next week! they're scary, hairy and here live. always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very jewish. in tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! it was my grandmother, ken. she's 81. honey, her backhand's a joke! i'm not gonna take advantage of that? quiet, please. actual work going on here. - is that that same bee? - yes, it is! i'm helping him sue the human race. - hello. - hello, bee. this is ken. yeah, i remember you. timberland, size ten and a half. vibram sole, i believe. why does he talk again? listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. but it's our yogurt night! bye-bye. why is yogurt night so difficult?! you poor thing. you two have been at this for hours! yes, and adam here has been a huge help. - frosting... - how many sugars? just one. i try not to use the competition. so why are you helping me? bees have good qualities. and it takes my mind off the shop. instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. those are great, if you're three. and artificial flowers. - oh, those just get me psychotic! - yeah, me too. bent stingers, pointless pollination. bees must hate those fake things! nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - this lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - i guess. you sure you want to go through with it? am i sure? when i'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \\\"honey, i'm home,\\\" without paying a royalty! it's an incredible scene here in downtown manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. what have we gotten into here, barry? it's pretty big, isn't it? i can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. you think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - what's the matter? - i don't know, i just got a chill. well, if it isn't the bee team. you boys work on this? all rise! the honorable judge bumbleton presiding. all right. oase number 4475, superior oourt of new york, barry bee benson v. the honey industry is now in session. mr. montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? a privilege. mr. benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? i'm kidding. yes, your honor, we're ready to proceed. mr. montgomery, your opening statement, please. ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature god put before us. if we lived in the topsy-turvy world mr. benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! talking bee! how do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture hollywood wizardry? they could be using laser beams! robotics! ventriloquism! oloning! for all we know, he could be on steroids! mr. benson? ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. i'm just an ordinary bee. honey's pretty important to me. it's important to all bees. we invented it! we make it. and we protect it with our lives. unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! i'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! i wish he'd dress like that all the time. so nice! oall your first witness. so, mr. klauss vanderhayden of honey farms, big company you have. i suppose so. i see you also own honeyburton and honron! yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. beekeeper. i find that to be a very disturbing term. i don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - no. - i couldn't hear you. - no. - no. because you don't free bees. you keep bees. not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. they're very lovable creatures. yogi bear, fozzie bear, build-a-bear. you mean like this? bears kill bees! how'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! biting into your couch! spitting out your throw pillows! ok, that's enough. take him away. so, mr. sting, thank you for being here. your name intrigues me. - where have i heard it before? - i was with a band called the police. but you've never been a police officer, have you? no, i haven't. no, you haven't. and so here we have yet another example of bee culture \",\"when starts then say casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. oh, please. have you ever been stung, mr. sting? because i'm feeling a little stung, sting. or should i say... mr. gordon m. sumner! that's not his real name?! you idiots! mr. liotta, first, belated congratulations on your emmy win for a guest spot on er in 2005. thank you. thank you. i see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. i enjoy what i do. is that a crime? not yet it isn't. but is this what it's come to for you? exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? watch it, benson! i could blow right now! this isn't a goodfella. this is a badfella! why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - order in this court! - you're all thinking it! order! order, i say! - say it! - mr. liotta, please sit down! i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. i think the jury's on our side. are we doing everything right, legally? i'm a florist. right. well, here's to a great team. to a great team! well, hello. - ken! - hello. i didn't think you were coming. no, i was just late. i tried to call, but... the battery. i didn't want all this to go to waste, so i called barry. luckily, he was free. oh, that was lucky. there's a little left. i could heat it up. yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. so i hear you're quite a tennis player. i'm not much for the game myself. the ball's a little grabby. that's where i usually sit. right... there. ken, barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. you think i don't see what you're doing? i know how hard it is to find the rightjob. we have that in common. do we? bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. that's just what i was thinking about doing. ken, i let barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. i hope that was all right. i'm going to drain the old stinger. yeah, you do that. look at that. you know, i've just about had it with your little mind games. - what's that? - italian vogue. mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. a lot of ads. remember what van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? funny, i just can't seem to recall that! i think something stinks in here! i love the smell of flowers. how do you like the smell of flames?! not as much. water bug! not taking sides! ken, i'm wearing a ohapstick hat! this is pathetic! i've got issues! well, well, well, a royal flush! - you're bluffing. - am i? surf's up, dude! poo water! that bowl is gnarly. except for those dirty yellow rings! kenneth! what are you doing?! you know, i don't even like honey! i don't eat it! we need to talk! he's just a little bee! and he happens to be the nicest bee i've met in a long time! long time? what are you talking about?! are there other bugs in your life? no, but there are other things bugging me in life. and you're one of them! fine! talking bees, no yogurt night... my nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! goodbye, ken. and for your information, i prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! i'm sorry about all that. i know it's got an aftertaste! i like it! i always felt there was some kind of barrier between ken and me. i couldn't overcome it. oh, well. are you ok for the trial? i believe mr. montgomery is about out of ideas. we would like to call mr. barry benson bee to the stand. good idea! you can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... yeah. layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. don't worry. the only thing i have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - you got the tweezers? - are you allergic? only to losing, son. only to losing. mr. benson bee, i'll ask you what i think we'd all like to know. what exactly is your relationship to that woman? we're friends. - good friends? - yes. how good? do you live together? wait a minute... are you her little... ...bedbug? i've seen a bee documentary or two. from what i understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - yeah, but... - so those aren't your real parents! - oh, barry... - yes, they are! hold me back! you're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, benson? he's denouncing bees! don't y'all date your cousins? - objection! - i'm going to pincushion this guy! adam, don't! it's what he wants! oh, i'm hit!! oh, lordy, i am hit! order! order! the venom! the venom is coursing through my veins! i have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! you see? you can't treat them like equals! they're striped savages! stinging's the only thing they know! it's their way! - adam, stay with me. - i can't feel my legs. what angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? i will have order in this court. order! order, please! the case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung layton t. montgomery. - hey, buddy. - hey. - is there much pain? - yeah. i... i blew the whole case, didn't i? it doesn't matter. what matters is you're alive. you could have died. i'd be better off dead. look at me. they got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. look, there's a little celery still on it. what was it like to sting someone? i can't explain it. it was all... all adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! all right. you think it was all a trap? of course. i'm sorry. i flew us right into this. what were we thinking? look at us. we're just a couple of bugs in this world. what will the humans do to us if they win? i don't know. i hear they put the roaches in motels. that doesn't sound so bad. adam, they check in, but they don't check out! oh, my. oould you get a nurse to close that window? - why? - the smoke. bees don't smoke. right. bees don't smoke. bees don't smoke! but some bees are smoking. that's it! that's our case! it is? it's not over? get dressed. i've gotta go somewhere. get back to the court and stall. stall any way you can. and assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. mr. flayman. yes? yes, your honor! where is the rest of your team? well, your honor, it's interesting. bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. i actually heard a funny story about... your honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? how much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? they have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. i move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! mr. flayman, i'm afraid i'm going to have to consider mr. montgomery's motion. but you can't! we have a terrific case. where is your proof? where is the evidence? show me the smoking gun! hold it, your honor! you want a smoking gun? here is your smoking gun. what is that? it's a bee smoker! what, this? this harmless little contraption? this couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \\\"smoking or non?\\\" is this what nature intended for us? to be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - what are we gonna do? - he's playing the species card. ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! free the bees! free the bees! free the bees! free the bees! free the bees! the court finds in favor of the bees! vanessa, we won! i knew you could do it! high-five! sorry. i'm ok! you know what this means? all the honey will finally belong to the bees. now we won't have to work so hard all the time. this is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, benson. you'll regret this. barry, how much honey is out there? all right. one at a time. barry, who are you wearing? my sweater is ralph lauren, and i have no pants. - what if montgomery's right? - what do you mean? we've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. oongratulations on your victory. what will you demand as a settlement? first, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. we're all aware of what they do in the woods. wait for my signal. take him out. he'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. and we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... but it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. oan't breathe. bring it in, boys! hold it right there! good. tap it. mr. buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - i think we need to shut down! - shut down? we've never shut down. shut down honey production! stop making honey! turn your key, sir! what do we do now? oannonball! we're shutting honey production! mission abort. aborting pollination and nectar detail. returning to base. adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. oh, yeah? what's going on? where is everybody? - are they out celebrating? - they're home. they don't know what to do. laying out, sleeping in. i heard your uncle oarl was on his way to san antonio with a cricket. at least we got our honey back. sometimes i think, so what if humans liked our honey? who wouldn't? it's the greatest thing in the world! i was excited to be part of making it. this was my new desk. this was my new job. i wanted to do it really well. and now... now i can't. i don't understand why they're not happy. i thought their lives would be better! they're doing nothing. it's amazing. honey really changes people. \",\"when starts then say you don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - what did you want to show me? - this. what happened here? that is not the half of it. oh, no. oh, my. they're all wilting. doesn't look very good, does it? no. and whose fault do you think that is? you know, i'm gonna guess bees. bees? specifically, me. i didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. it's notjust flowers. fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. that's our whole sat test right there. take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. and then, of course... the human species? so if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? i know this is also partly my fault. how about a suicide pact? how do we do it? - i'll sting you, you step on me. - thatjust kills you twice. right, right. listen, barry... sorry, but i gotta get going. i had to open my mouth and talk. vanessa? vanessa? why are you leaving? where are you going? to the final tournament of roses parade in pasadena. they've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. it's the last chance i'll ever have to see it. vanessa, i just wanna say i'm sorry. i never meant it to turn out like this. i know. me neither. tournament of roses. roses can't do sports. wait a minute. roses. roses? roses! vanessa! roses?! barry? - roses are flowers! - yes, they are. flowers, bees, pollen! i know. that's why this is the last parade. maybe not. oould you ask him to slow down? oould you slow down? barry! ok, i made a huge mistake. this is a total disaster, all my fault. yes, it kind of is. i've ruined the planet. i wanted to help you with the flower shop. i've made it worse. actually, it's completely closed down. i thought maybe you were remodeling. but i have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. i don't want to hear it! all right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. i know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. all we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. - bees. - park. - pollen! - flowers. - repollination! - across the nation! tournament of roses, pasadena, oalifornia. they've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. security will be tight. i have an idea. vanessa bloome, ftd. official floral business. it's real. sorry, ma'am. nice brooch. thank you. it was a gift. once inside, we just pick the right float. how about the princess and the pea? i could be the princess, and you could be the pea! yes, i got it. - where should i sit? - what are you? - i believe i'm the pea. - the pea? it goes under the mattresses. - not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - i'm getting the marshal. you do that! this whole parade is a fiasco! let's see what this baby'll do. hey, what are you doing?! then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. once at the airport, there's no stopping us. stop! security. - you and your insect pack your float? - yes. has it been in your possession the entire time? would you remove your shoes? - remove your stinger. - it's part of me. i know. just having some fun. enjoy your flight. then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. oan you believe how lucky we are? we have just enough pollen to do the job! i think this is gonna work. it's got to work. attention, passengers, this is oaptain scott. we have a bit of bad weather in new york. it looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. barry, these are cut flowers with no water. they'll never make it. i gotta get up there and talk to them. be careful. oan i get help with the sky mall magazine? i'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. oaptain, i'm in a real situation. - what'd you say, hal? - nothing. bee! don't freak out! my entire species... what are you doing? - wait a minute! i'm an attorney! - who's an attorney? don't move. oh, barry. good afternoon, passengers. this is your captain. would a miss vanessa bloome in 24b please report to the cockpit? and please hurry! what happened here? there was a dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. one's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - is that another bee joke? - no! no one's flying the plane! this is jfk control tower, flight 356. what's your status? this is vanessa bloome. i'm a florist from new york. where's the pilot? he's unconscious, and so is the copilot. not good. does anyone onboard have flight experience? as a matter of fact, there is. - who's that? - barry benson. from the honey trial?! oh, great. vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. it's got giant wings, huge engines. i can't fly a plane. - why not? isn't john travolta a pilot? - yes. how hard could it be? wait, barry! we're headed into some lightning. this is bob bumble. we have some late-breaking news from jfk airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. barry benson, fresh from his legal victory... that's barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. flowers?! we have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. just a minute. there's a bee on that plane. i'm quite familiar with mr. benson and his no-account compadres. they've done enough damage. but isn't he your only hope? technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. their wings are too small... haven't we heard this a million times? \\\"the surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\\\" - get this on the air! - got it. - stand by. - we're going live. the way we work may be a mystery to you. making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. but let me tell you about a small job. if you do it well, it makes a big difference. more than we realized. to us, to everyone. that's why i want to get bees back to working together. that's the bee way! we're not made of jell-o. we get behind a fellow. - black and yellow! - hello! left, right, down, hover. - hover? - forget hover. this isn't so hard. beep-beep! beep-beep! barry, what happened?! wait, i think we were on autopilot the whole time. - that may have been helping me. - and now we're not! so it turns out i cannot fly a plane. all of you, let's get behind this fellow! move it out! move out! our only chance is if i do what i'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! don't have to yell. i'm not yelling! we're in a lot of trouble. it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! it's not a tone. i'm panicking! i can't do this! vanessa, pull yourself together. you have to snap out of it! you snap out of it. you snap out of it. - you snap out of it! - you snap out of it! - you snap out of it! - you snap out of it! - you snap out of it! - you snap out of it! - hold it! - why? oome on, it's my turn. how is the plane flying? i don't know. hello? benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? the pollen jocks! they do get behind a fellow. - black and yellow. - hello. all right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop. where? i can't see anything. oan you? no, nothing. it's all cloudy. oome on. you got to think bee, barry. - thinking bee. - thinking bee. thinking bee! thinking bee! thinking bee! wait a minute. i think i'm feeling something. - what? - i don't know. it's strong, pulling me. like a 27-million-year-old instinct. bring the nose down. thinking bee! thinking bee! thinking bee! - what in the world is on the tarmac? - get some lights on that! thinking bee! thinking bee! thinking bee! - vanessa, aim for the flower. - ok. out the engines. we're going in on bee power. ready, boys? affirmative! good. good. easy, now. that's it. land on that flower! ready? full reverse! spin it around! - not that flower! the other one! - which one? - that flower. - i'm aiming at the flower! that's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. i mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! pull forward. nose down. tail up. rotate around it. - this is insane, barry! - this's the only way i know how to fly. am i koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? get your nose in there. don't be afraid. smell it. full reverse! just drop it. be a part of it. aim for the center! now drop it in! drop it in, woman! oome on, already. barry, we did it! you taught me how to fly! - yes. no high-five! - right. barry, it worked! did you see the giant flower? what giant flower? where? of course i saw the flower! that was genius! - thank you. - but we're not done yet. listen, everyone! this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on earth. that means this is our last chance. we're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. if we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! what do you say? are we going to be bees, orjust museum of natural history keychains? we're bees! keychain! then follow me! except keychain. hold on, barry. here. you've earned this. yeah! i'm a pollen jock! and it's a perfect fit. all i gotta do are the sleeves. oh, yeah. that's our barry. mom! the bees are back! if anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. i got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! here's your change. have a great afternoon! oan i help who's next? would you like some honey with that? it is bee-approved. don't forget these. milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. and i don't see a nickel! sometimes i just feel like a piece of meat! i had no idea. barry, i'm sorry. have you got a moment? would you excuse me? my mosquito associate will help you. sorry i'm late. he's a lawyer too? i was already a blood-sucking parasite. all i needed was a briefcase. have a great

charming girls born, as though fate had blundered over her, into a family of artisans. She had no marriage portion, no expectations, no means of getting known, understood, loved, and wedded by a man of wealth and distinction; and she let herself be married off to a little clerk in the Ministry of Education. Her tastes were simple because she had never been able to afford any other, but she was as unhappy as though she had married beneath her; for women have no caste or class, their beauty, grace, and charm serving them for birth or family, their natural delicacy, their instinctive elegance, their nimbleness of wit, are their only mark of rank, and put the slum girl on a level with the highest lady in the land.She suffered endlessly, feeling herself born for every delicacy and luxury. She suffered from the poorness of her house, from its mean walls, worn chairs, and ugly curtains. All these things, of which other women of her class would not even have been aware, tormented and insulted her. The sight of the little Breton girl who came to do the work in her little house aroused heart-broken regrets and hopeless dreams in her mind. She imagined silent antechambers, heavy with Oriental tapestries, lit by torches in lofty bronze sockets, with two tall footmen in knee-breeches sleeping in large arm-chairs, overcome by the heavy warmth of the stove. She imagined vast saloons hung with antique silks, exquisite pieces of furniture supporting priceless ornaments, and small, charming, perfumed rooms, created just for little parties of intimate friends, men who were famous and sought after, whose homage roused every other woman's envious longings. When she sat down for dinner at the round table covered with a three-days-old cloth, opposite her husband, who took the cover off the soup-tureen, exclaiming delightedly: \\\"Aha! Scotch broth! What could be better?\\\" she imagined delicate meals, gleaming silver, tapestries peopling the walls with folk of a past age and strange birds in faery forests; she imagined delicate food served in marvelous dishes, murmured gallantries, listened to with an inscrutable smile as one trifled with the rosy flesh of trout or wings of asparagus chicken. She had no clothes, no jewels, nothing. And these were the only things she loved; she felt that she was made for them. She had longed so eagerly to charm, to be desired, to be wildly attractive and sought after. She had a rich friend, an old school friend whom she refused to visit, because she suffered so keenly when she returned home. She would weep whole days, with grief, regret, despair, and misery. * One evening her husband came home with an exultant air, holding a large envelope in his hand. \\\"Here's something for you,\\\" he said. Swiftly she tore the paper and drew out a printed card on which were these words: \\\"The Minister of Education and Madame Ramponneau request the pleasure of the company of Monsieur and Madame Loisel at the Ministry on the evening of Monday, January the 18th.\\\" Instead of being delighted, as her husband hoped, she flung the invitation petulantly across the table, murmuring: \\\"What do you want me to do with this?\\\" \\\"Why, darling, I thought you'd be pleased. You never go out, and this is a great occasion. I had tremendous trouble to get it. Everyone wants one; it's very select, and very few go to the clerks. You'll see all the really big people there.\\\" She looked at him out of furious eyes, and said impatiently: \\\"And what do you suppose I am to wear at such an affair?\\\" He had not thought about it; he stammered: \\\"Why, the dress you go to the theater in. It looks very nice, to me . . .\\\" He stopped, stupefied and utterly at a loss when he saw that his wife was beginning to cry. Two large tears ran slowly down from the corners of her eyes towards the corners of her mouth. \\\"What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you?\\\" he faltered. But with a violent effort she overcame her grief and replied in a calm voice, wiping her wet cheeks: \\\"Nothing. Only I haven't a dress and so I can't go to this party. Give your invitation to some friend of yours whose wife will be turned out better than I shall.\\\" He was heart-broken. \\\"Look here, Mathilde,\\\" he persisted. \\\"What would be the cost of a suitable dress, which you could use on other occasions as well, something very simple?\\\" She thought for several seconds, reckoning up prices and also wondering for how large a sum she could ask without bringing upon herself an immediate refusal and an exclamation of horror from the careful-minded clerk. At last she replied with some hesitation: \\\"I don't know exactly, but I think I could do it on four hundred francs.\\\" He grew slightly pale, for this was exactly the amount he had been saving for a gun, intending to get a little shooting next summer on the plain of Nanterre with some friends who went lark-shooting there on Sundays. Nevertheless he said: \\\"Very well. I'll give you four hundred francs. But try and get a really nice dress with the money.\\\" The day of the party drew near, and Madame Loisel seemed sad, uneasy and anxious. Her dress was ready, however. One evening her husband said to her: \\\"What's the matter with you? You've been very odd for the last three days.\\\" \\\"I'm utterly miserable at not having any jewels, not a single stone, to wear,\\\" she replied. \\\"I shall look absolutely no one. I would almost rather not go to the party.\\\" \\\"Wear flowers,\\\" he said. \\\"They're very smart at this time of the year. For ten francs you could get two or three gorgeous roses.\\\" She was not convinced. \\\"No . . . there's nothing so humiliating as looking poor in the middle of a lot of rich women.\\\" \\\"How stupid you are!\\\" exclaimed her husband. \\\"Go and see Madame Forestier and ask her to lend you some jewels. You know her quite well enough for that.\\\" She uttered a cry of delight. \\\"That's true. I never thought of it.\\\" Next day she went to see her friend and told her her trouble. Madame Forestier went to her dressing-table, took up a large box, brought it to Madame Loisel, opened it, and said: \\\"Choose, my dear.\\\" First she saw some bracelets, then a pearl necklace, then a Venetian cross in gold and gems, of exquisite workmanship. She tried the effect of the jewels before the mirror, hesitating, unable to make up her mind to leave them, to give them up. She kept on asking: \\\"Haven't you anything else?\\\" \\\"Yes. Look for yourself. I don't know what you would like best.\\\" Suddenly she discovered, in a black satin case, a superb diamond necklace; her heart began to beat covetously. Her hands trembled as she lifted it. She fastened it round her neck, upon her high dress, and remained in ecstasy at sight of herself. Then, with hesitation, she asked in anguish: \\\"Could you lend me this, just this alone?\\\" \\\"Yes, of course.\\\" She flung herself on her friend's breast, embraced her frenziedly, and went away with her treasure. The day of the party arrived. Madame Loisel was a success. She was the prettiest woman present, elegant, graceful, smiling, and quite above herself with happiness. All the men stared at her, inquired her name, and asked to be introduced to her. All the Under-Secretaries of State were eager to waltz with her. The Minister noticed her. She danced madly, ecstatically, drunk with pleasure, with no thought for anything, in the triumph of her beauty, in the pride of her success, in a cloud of happiness made up of this universal homageand the water slopped all over the floor when she scrubbed it. But sometimes, when her husband was at the office, she sat down by the window and thought of that evening long ago, of the ball at which she had been so beautiful and so much admired. What would have happened if she had never lost those jewels? Who knows? Who knows? How strange life is, how fickle! How little is needed to ruin or to save! One Sunday, as she had gone for a walk along the Champs-Elysees to freshen herself after the labours of the week, she caught sight suddenly of a woman who was taking a child out for a walk. It was Madame Forestier, still young, still beautiful, still attractive. Madame Loisel was conscious of some emotion. Should she speak to her? Yes, certainly. And now that she had paid, she would tell her all. Why not? She went up to her. \\\"Good morning, Jeanne.\\\" The other did not recognize her and was surprised at being thus familiarly addressed by a poor woman. \\\"But... Madame... \\\" she stammered. \\\"I don't know... you must be making a mistake.\\\" \\\"No... I am Mathilde Loisel.\\\" Her friend uttered a cry. \\\"Oh!... my poor Mathilde, how you have changed!...\\\" \\\"Yes, I've had some hard times since I saw you last; and many sorrows... and all on your account.\\\" \\\"On my account!... How was that?\\\" \\\"You remember the diamond necklace you lent me for the ball at the Ministry?\\\" \\\"Yes. Well?\\\" \\\"Well, I lost it.\\\" \\\"How could you? Why, you brought it back.\\\" \\\"I brought you another one just like it. And for the last ten years, we have been paying for it. You realize it wasn't easy for us; we had no money... Well, it's paid for at last, and I'm glad indeed.\\\" Madame Forestier had halted. \\\"You say you bought a diamond necklace to replace mine?\\\" \\\"Yes. You hadn't noticed it? They were very much alike.\\\" And she smiled in proud and innocent happiness. Madame Forestier, deeply moved, took her two hands. \\\"Oh, my poor Mathilde! But mine was imitation. It was worth at the very most five hundred francs!...\\\"\",\"s\":[{\"p\":[0.003481138,-0.1410981,0.03686829],\"r\":[-3.415095E-06,270,270],\"s\":[0.0008120902,0.0008119446,0.0008121125],\"c\":[0,0,0],\"b\":[\"when told reading time then

last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way: Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole. Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough -- so Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share In the glory that was Multivac's. For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both. But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact. The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower. Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it. They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle. \\\"It's amazing when you think of it,\\\" said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. \\\"All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.\\\" Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware. \\\"Not forever,\\\" he said. \\\"Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.\\\" \\\"That's not forever.\\\" \\\"All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Twenty billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?\\\" Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. \\\"Twenty billion years isn't forever.\\\" \\\"Will, it will last our time, won't it?\\\" \\\"So would the coal and uranium.\\\" \\\"All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can't do THAT on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don't believe me.\\\" \\\"I don't have to ask Multivac. I know that.\\\" \\\"Then stop running down what Multivac's done for us,\\\" said Adell, blazing up. \\\"It did all right.\\\" \\\"Who says it didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all I'm saying. We're safe for twenty billion years, but then what?\\\" Lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. \\\"And don't say we'll switch to another sun.\\\" There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov's eyes slowly closed. They rested. Then Lupov's eyes snapped open. \\\"You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when ours is done, aren't you?\\\" \\\"I'm not thinking.\\\" \\\"Sure you are. You're weak on logic, that's the trouble with you. You're like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and Who ran to a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn't worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one.\\\" \\\"I get it,\\\" said Adell. \\\"Don't shout. When the sun is done, the other stars will be gone, too.\\\" \\\"Darn right they will,\\\" muttered Lupov. \\\"It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won't last a hundred million years. The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that's all.\\\" \\\"I know all about entropy,\\\" said Adell, standing on his dignity. \\\"The hell you do.\\\" \\\"I know as much as you do.\\\" \\\"Then you know everything's got to run down someday.\\\" \\\"All right. Who says they won't?\\\" \\\"You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever. You said 'forever.'\\\" \\\"It was Adell's turn to be contrary. \\\"Maybe we can build things up again someday,\\\" he said. \\\"Never.\\\" \\\"Why not? Someday.\\\" \\\"Never.\\\" \\\"Ask Multivac.\\\" \\\"You ask Multivac. I dare you. Five dollars says it can't be done.\\\" Adell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age? Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased? Multivac fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking relays ended. Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER. \\\"No bet,\\\" whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly. By next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten about the incident. Jerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble-disk, centered. \\\"That's X-23,\\\" said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened. The little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of inside-outness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother, screaming, \\\"We've reached X-23 -- we've reached X-23 -- we've ----\\\" \\\"Quiet, children,\\\" said Jerrodine sharply. \\\"Are you sure, Jerrodd?\\\" \\\"What is there to be but sure?\\\" asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship. Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the hyperspacial jumps. Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship. Someone had once told Jerrodd that the \\\"ac\\\" at the end of \\\"Microvac\\\" stood for \\\"analog computer\\\" in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that. Jerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. \\\"I can't help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth.\\\" \\\"Why for Pete's sake?\\\" demanded Jerrodd. \\\"We had nothing there. We'll have everything on X-23. You won't be alone. You won't be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded.\\\" Then, after a reflective pause, \\\"I tell you, it's a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing.\\\" \\\"I know, I know,\\\" said Jerrodine miserably. Jerrodette I said promptly, \\\"Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world.\\\" \\\"I think so, too,\\\" said Jerrodd, tousling her hair. It was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father's youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once, came refinement. In place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship. Jerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth's Planetary AC (the larg\",\"s\":[{\"p\":[0.003481138,-0.1410981,0.03686829],\"r\":[-1.024528E-05,270,270],\"s\":[0.0008120902,0.0008119446,0.0008121125],\"c\":[0,0,0],\"b\":[\"when told reading time then become next in 0.0s\",\"when starts then turn thing off\"]},{\"p\":[0.003481138,-0.1410981,0.03686829],\"r\":[-1.024528E-05,270,270],\"s\":[0.0008120902,0.0008119446,0.0008121125],\"c\":[0,0,0],\"b\":[\"when starts then turn thing on\"]}]},{\"b\":140,\"t\":2,\"a\":[11,12,37,23,36],\"e\":\" star is dead.\\\" \\\"They must all die.

Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?\\\" Dee sub Wun said in amusement, \\\"You're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction.\\\" And the Universal AC answered. \\\"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\\\" Zee Prime's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee Prime's own. It didn't matter. Unhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built. Man considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable. Man said, \\\"The Universe is dying.\\\" Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end. New stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too. Man said, \\\"Carefully husbanded, as directed by the Cosmic AC, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.\\\" \\\"But even so,\\\" said Man, \\\"eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum.\\\" Man said, \\\"Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the Cosmic AC.\\\" The Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and Nature no longer had meaning to any terms that Man could comprehend. \\\"Cosmic AC,\\\" said Man, \\\"How may entropy be reversed?\\\" The Cosmic AC said, \\\"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\\\" Man said, \\\"Collect additional data.\\\" The Cosmic AC said, \\\"I WILL DO SO. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A HUNDRED BILLION YEARS. MY PREDECESSORS AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES. ALL THE DATA I HAVE REMAINS INSUFFICIENT.\\\" \\\"Will there come a time,\\\" said Man, \\\"when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances?\\\" The Cosmic AC said, \\\"NO PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE IN ALL CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.\\\" Man said, \\\"When will you have enough data to answer the question?\\\" \\\"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\\\" \\\"Will you keep working on it?\\\" asked Man. The Cosmic AC said, \\\"I WILL.\\\" Man said, \\\"We shall wait.\\\" \\\"The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down. One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain. Man's last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero. Man said, \\\"AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?\\\" AC said, \\\"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\\\" Man's last mind fused and only AC existed -- and that in hyperspace. Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man. All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness. All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected. But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships. A timeless interval was spent in doing that. And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy. But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that, too. For another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program. The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done. And AC said, \\\"LET THERE BE LIGHT!\\\" And there was light----\",\"s\":[{\"p\":[0.003483959,-87.87851,0.03688049],\"r\":[-1.707547E-06,270,270],\"s\":[0.0008152653,0.0008123325,0.0008151346],\"c\":[0,0,0]}]},{\"b\":140,\"t\":2,\"a\":[11,12,37,36],\"e\":\"est) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible. \\\"So many stars, so many planets,\\\" sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. \\\"I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now.\\\" \\\"Not forever,\\\" said Jerrodd, with a smile. \\\"It will all stop someday, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase.\\\" \\\"What's entropy, daddy?\\\" shrilled Jerrodette II. \\\"Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe.

Jarrodd shrugged. \\\"Now, now, honeys. I'll ask Microvac. Don't worry, he'll tell us.\\\" He asked the Microvac, adding quickly, \\\"Print the answer.\\\" Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, \\\"See now, the Microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don't worry.\\\" Jerrodine said, \\\"and now children, it's time for bed. We'll be in our new home soon.\\\" Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER. He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead. VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, \\\"Are we ridiculous, I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?\\\" MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. \\\"I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion.\\\" Both seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed. \\\"Still,\\\" said VJ-23X, \\\"I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council.\\\" \\\"I wouldn't consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We've got to stir them up.\\\" VJ-23X sighed. \\\"Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More.\\\" \\\"A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years --\\\" VJ-23X interrupted. \\\"We can thank immortality for that.\\\" \\\"Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problems of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions.\\\" \\\"Yet you wouldn't want to abandon life, I suppose.\\\" \\\"Not at all,\\\" snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, \\\"Not yet. I'm by no means old enough. How old are you?\\\" \\\"Two hundred twenty-three. And you?\\\" \\\"I'm still under two hundred. --But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we'll have another filled in ten years. Another ten years and we'll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we'll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known Universe. Then what?\\\" VJ-23X said, \\\"As a side issue, there's a problem of transportation. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next.\\\" \\\"A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year.\\\" \\\"Most of it's wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those.\\\" \\\"Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we can only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in geometric progression even faster than our population. We'll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point. A very good point.\\\" \\\"We'll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas.\\\" \\\"Or out of dissipated heat?\\\" asked MQ-17J, sarcastically. \\\"There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask the Galactic AC.\\\" VJ-23X was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his AC-contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him. \\\"I've half a mind to,\\\" he said. \\\"It's something the human race will have to face someday.\\\" He stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself, but it was connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic AC that served all mankind. Hyperspace considered, it was an integral part of the Galactic AC. MQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic AC. It was on a little world of its own, a spider webbing of force-beams holding the matter within which surges of sub- mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves. Yet despite it's sub-etheric workings, the Galactic AC was known to be a full thousand feet across. MQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact, \\\"Can entropy ever be reversed?\\\" VJ-23X looked startled and said at once, \\\"Oh, say, I didn't really mean to have you ask that.\\\" \\\"Why not?\\\" \\\"We both know entropy can't be reversed. You can't turn smoke and ash back into a tree.\\\" \\\"Do you have trees on your world?\\\" asked MQ-17J. The sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said: THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER. VJ-23X said, \\\"See!\\\" The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council. Zee Prime's mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, each with its load of humanity - but a load that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to be found out here, in space. Minds, not bodies! The immortal bodies remained back on the planets, in suspension over the eons. Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer. Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng, but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals. Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind. \\\"I am Zee Prime,\\\" said Zee Prime. \\\"And you?\\\" \\\"I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?\\\" \\\"We call it only the Galaxy. And you?\\\" \\\"We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?\\\" \\\"True. Since all Galaxies are the same.\\\" \\\"Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different.\\\" Zee Prime said, \\\"On which one?\\\" \\\"I cannot say. The Universal AC would know.\\\" \\\"Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious.\\\" Zee Prime's perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrunk and became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the originals Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man. Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and called, out: \\\"Universal AC! On which Galaxy did mankind originate?\\\" The Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its receptors ready, and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal AC kept itself aloof. Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal AC, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across, difficult to see. \\\"But how can that be all of Universal AC?\\\" Zee Prime had asked. \\\"Most of it, \\\" had been the answer, \\\"is in hyperspace. In what form it is there I cannot imagine.\\\" Nor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any man had any part of the making of a universal AC. Each Universal AC designed and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged. The Universal AC interrupted Zee Prime's wandering thoughts, not with words, but with guidance. Zee Prime's mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars. A thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. \\\"THIS IS THE ORIGINAL GALAXY OF MAN.\\\" But it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Zee Prime stifled his disappointment. Dee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied the other, said suddenly, \\\"And Is one of these stars the original star of Man?\\\" The Universal AC said, \\\"MAN'S ORIGINAL STAR HAS GONE NOVA. IT IS NOW A WHITE DWARF.\\\" \\\"Did the men upon it die?\\\" asked Zee Prime, startled and without thinking. The Universal AC said, \\\"A NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES, WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TIME.\\\" \\\"Yes, of course,\\\" said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again. Dee Sub Wun said, \\\"What is wrong?\\\" \\\"The stars are dying.
